<strong>1 </strong>Consider a discrete-time linear system with two states and one control:

<em>x</em><sup>+ </sup>= <em>Ax </em>+ <em>Bu</em>

Take X to be the unit box centered at the origin and U = [−1<em>,</em>1].

<ol>

 <li>Describe (in words) the geometry of the viable subset of X.</li>

 <li>Write a Matlab function that receives <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>and plots the boundaries of the viable set.</li>

 <li>Write a Matlab function that receives <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>and a horizon <em>N </em>and plots the boundaries of the feasible set X<em><sub>N </sub></em>corresponding to the terminal set X<sub>0 </sub>given by a circle centered at the origin with radius 0.5.</li>

</ol>

Consider the system

<em>x</em><sup>+ </sup>= <em>Ax </em>+ <em>Bu</em>

with A=[1 0 1;0 0 -1;1 2 1];B=[2 0;-1 0;0 1]. For <em>Q </em>= <em>I</em><sub>3</sub>, <em>R </em>= <em>I</em><sub>2 </sub>and <em>Q<sub>f </sub></em>= 10<em>I</em><sub>3</sub>, solve the finite-horizon LQR problem using the Riccati backward recursion. Write code to simulate the control system for any desired horizon. Choose a convenient horizon and plot the resulting trajectories as a function of time and in a 3D phase plot.

Work out every step of the proof of Theorem 4.3 in the textbook by Gru¨ne and Pannek, finding a justification for each step taken for the case <em>λ </em>= 0. Then repeat the proof for arbitrary <em>λ </em>≥ 0 assuming that asymptotic controllability holds with the small control property. Be prepared to discuss your reasoning during class on 11/01.
